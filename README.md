Solving Mixed-Fleet Vehicle Routing Problems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Bilinear-Pooling-Enhanced Transformer
The 'options' stores various variable parameters required for running the code. The 'generate_MFVRP_data' file is used to generate data, while 'reinforce_baselines' serves as the baseline file. The 'train' component contains functions related to model training, and the 'run' file is employed for formal model training. The 'test' module is utilized to apply the trained model to specific instances for testing. Within the 'nets' folder, the 'Attention_model' file stores the primary attention model and the bilinear pooling module, and the 'GAT_encoder' file houses the encoder. In the 'problems' file, 'state_mfvrp' defines the state and state transition-related content. Additionally, the 'data' file includes a small-scale MFVRP instance.
